            <p className='homep'>I was born and raised in San Ignaico, Paraguay<Flag name='py'/>
            In the heart of South America I developed a passion early on for
            computers and everything about them. This is what led me to study
            Computer Engineering at the Universidad Catolica.</p>
            <p className='homep'>I moved to Washington DC in January of 2016.
            After years of rising through the ranks at Chipotle I decided to take
            the plunge and go back to what I loved. That is when I enrolled at
            Flatiron School to study Software Engineering. I finished the program
            in February 2020 and am excited to put my new skills into action.</p>
            <p className='homep'>In my free time I love to spend time with friends
            and family. I play basketball, soccer (or futbol as its called everywhere
            else in the world), ping pong and video games.</p>
